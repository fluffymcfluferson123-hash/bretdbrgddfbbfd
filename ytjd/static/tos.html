      <li>
        The safest way to use PHSP is by using its official deployments or by

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 2.1: Summary - Official PHSP Deployment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Official PHSP deployments are run with privacy in mind.
        <b>
          We do temporarily collect and retain some PII such as IP addresses used to access the official PHSP deployment, but this is not intentional.
        </b>

        responsible if your data such as an account becomes compromised as a result of malicious code in an unofficial PHSP deployment.

    <h2>Section 5: The information we collect</h2>

    <h3>Section 5.1: The official PHSP deployment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Information that may be unintentionally collected as part of using PHSP's official deployment may include basic information such as your IP
        address, web traffic when using PHSP, etc. This information is temporary and is kept until the server is rebooted.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not purposefully collect anyone's information. We try to limit the data collected by the official PHSP deployment.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We do not, will not, and will never knowingly collect the information of minors under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by laws in your
        country).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 5.2: Unofficial PHSP Deployments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We can't give a definitive answer on what information is collected when you use an unofficial PHSP deployment; only the operator of the
        PHSP deployment you're using can.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>We urge operators to collect and store as minimal information as possible, but we can't control what they do.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 6: Control</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not have the power to control what unofficial PHSP deployment operators do with their deployment.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We protect information stored on the official PHSP deployment by limiting access. The only person that has access to the server on which the
        official PHSP deployment runs is the server host and the owner of PHSP, xbubbo.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We cannot check every deployment for malicious code. If any data such as your account gets compromised after you access it on an unofficial PHSP
        deployment, we will not be held liable.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 7: How we use basic information on the official PHSP deployment that may be collected accidentally</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your IP address is used to allow you to use the PHSP service. This is how it works for every website you visit, not just PHSP. The
        difference is whether or not this data is intentionally collected and stored.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Info about your web traffic while using PHSP is needed to allow you to access the service you wish to access.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        PHSP will NEVER sell your info to third parties, other than to some ad companies. We do this so we can make enough money to pay for our server.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The official PHSP server operator may respond to legal requests and assist law enforcement officials in legal investigations if ever needed. We
        can't guarantee we'll always have information to hand out as the information that may be collected is automatically destroyed on reboot, but if we do
        still have information relevant to the investigation, we may provide law enforcement officials with it. Please redirect all requests regarding data with
        an unofficial PHSP deployment to its operator, as we don't have control over unofficial deployments and couldn't comply with requests even if we
        wanted to.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 8: Supporters ❤</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You may choose to support PHSP by joining our
        <a href="https://discord.gg/phsp">Discord community</a>, then purchasing a payment plan on the
        <a href="https://patreon.com/gophsp">Patreon page</a> or by sending
        <a href="https://cash.app/$akabubbo">$akabubbo money on Cash App.</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As a thank you for supporting PHSP, you get access to supporter features. This includes a server with a PHSP deployment for supporters
        only. We cannot guarantee 100% uptime. We reserve the right to discontinue any supporter perks at any time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>This is NON-REFUNDABLE.</li>
    </ul>
